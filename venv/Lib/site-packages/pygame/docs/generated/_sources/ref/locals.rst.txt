| :sl:`pygame constants`

This module contains various constants used by pygame. Its contents are
automatically placed in the pygame module namespace. However, an application
can use ``pygame.locals`` to include only the pygame constants with a ``from
pygame.locals import *``.

Detailed descriptions of the various constants can be found throughout the
<<<<<<< HEAD
pygame documentation. Here are the locations of some of them.
